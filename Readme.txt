Analysis of the Real Estate Market in Ames, Iowa
This project aimed to analyze the real estate market in Ames, Iowa, using the popular Ames Housing dataset available on Kaggle: Ames Housing Dataset.

The objective of our project was to create the most effective machine learning model that would allow us to select significant parameters with a real impact on house prices. We focused on identifying those parameters that could be changed by developers building or renovating properties without significant costs. We conducted research to assess the costs of specific changes and determine whether the added value of these changes exceeded their cost. For example, we investigated whether adding a fireplace to a house was worthwhile, considering whether its added value outweighed the installation cost.

The "ML.ipynb" file contains the processes of machine learning model selection, training, and analysis of the results.

The "Data Cleaning.ipynb" file encompasses the entire data cleaning process, which was relatively straightforward.

Instructions
To use our project, follow these steps:

Download the Ames Housing Dataset from the Kaggle website and save it in the project's main directory.

Open the "Data Cleaning.ipynb" file and run it in Jupyter Notebook or any other Python environment.

This file includes all the necessary steps to clean the data according to our needs. You can customize this process if you require additional data modifications.

Next, open the "ML.ipynb" file and run it in Jupyter Notebook or any other Python environment.

In this file, we conducted the process of selecting and training the machine learning model, as well as analyzing the obtained results. You can customize this process or the model according to your specific needs.
